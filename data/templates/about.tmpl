		<h1>About This Pool</h1>

		<div class="card">
			<h2>Server Infrastructure</h2>
			<p>Our main server is located in Detroit, Michigan USA at a major peering location with direct connections to three tier 1 network carriers: Cogent, Hurricane Electric, and GTT. The server runs on dual-socket Xeon E5-2680 v4 processors with 64GB RAM, SSD storage, and a dedicated gigabit fiber link.</p>
			<p><strong>Important note on latency:</strong> While low ping to the stratum server improves your mining efficiency, what actually matters for winning blocks is the complete path: miner to stratum server, stratum server to Bitcoin node, and Bitcoin node to the network. A pool could have great stratum latency but if the connection between their stratum server and Bitcoin node is slow, or if their node has poor network connectivity, your winning block could get orphaned. Our infrastructure prioritizes the entire chain: responsive stratum connections, local high-speed connection to our Bitcoin node, AND well-peered node connectivity with multiple tier 1 network paths for rapid block propagation.</p>

			<h2>Payment System</h2>
			<p>We use a split-coinbase payout system, which means you get paid directly from block rewards rather than through a pool wallet. Your Bitcoin wallet address is verified at connection time before any work is sent to your miner. You can verify all coinbase outputs on your worker page to confirm the payout structure.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="card">
			<h2>Technical Details</h2>
			<p>Our pool software is custom-built using Go, chosen for its reliability and performance. We run a Bitcoin Core node and use both RPC and ZMQ for low-latency block template updates. Each miner connection operates independently on its own goroutine, ensuring responsive communication even under load.</p>
			<p>The pool software is open source and available on our <a href="https://github.com/Distortions81/M45-Core-goPool" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repository</a> under the AGPL license. We believe in transparency and welcome code review and contributions.</p>

			<h2>Pool Fee Structure & Reality Check</h2>
			<p>We charge a 2% pool fee. Running quality infrastructure with proper peering, reliable hardware, and dedicated bandwidth has real costs. Solo mining pools don't find blocks frequently, so covering operational expenses with a sustainable fee structure is essential for long-term reliability.</p>
			<p><strong>Being honest:</strong> We'll struggle just to cover costs, and we don't know when - or even if - we'll find a block. Solo mining is a lottery where small pools can go months or years without finding anything. We're running this infrastructure because we believe in decentralization, but there are no guarantees.</p>
			<p>And it gets harder: <strong>In 2028, the block reward halves from 3.125 BTC to 1.5625 BTC.</strong> When that happens, everyone's share of each block gets cut in half, making it even more challenging to sustain operations. This is the reality of solo mining economics that every small pool faces.</p>

			<h2>Choosing a Trustworthy Pool</h2>
			<p>The mining pool landscape includes operators with varying levels of transparency and integrity. When evaluating pools, it's important to consider the economics: quality infrastructure, bandwidth, and reliable servers cost money. Pools advertising extremely low fees face a fundamental question: how do they sustain operations?</p>
			<p><strong>More concerning:</strong> Some pools have been found to have coinbase transactions that don't reward miners at all. The work you submit may not even be contributing to your potential payout. This is why verifying on-chain payouts is critical.</p>
			<p>When evaluating any pool, consider these possibilities:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>No miner payouts</strong> - Coinbase outputs that don't include miner addresses at all, meaning your work earns nothing</li>
				<li><strong>Insufficient infrastructure</strong> - Cutting costs through unreliable hardware, poor network connectivity, or shared hosting that can't handle load</li>
				<li><strong>Subsidized operations</strong> - Running at a loss temporarily to build market share, with no guarantee of long-term sustainability</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We believe transparency is essential. Our code is open source, our payout structure is verifiable on-chain, and our fee structure reflects actual operational costs. <strong>Be skeptical and investigate every pool before committing your hashrate.</strong></p>
			<p>To help verify pool behavior, check out the <a href="https://github.com/WantClue/pool-investigator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pool Investigator</a> tool by WantClue, which analyzes on-chain data to verify whether pools are actually paying miners as claimed.</p>

			<h2>Future Plans</h2>
			<p>We're committed to providing reliable mining infrastructure. As the pool grows, we hope to expand with additional server locations within the United States and potentially Europe, offering miners more geographic diversity and lower latency options.</p>
