		<h1>About This Pool</h1>

		<div class="card">
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>We're a solo mining pool running open-source software with split-coinbase payouts and transparent operations. This is true solo mining: if your miner finds a block, you get the block reward. We don't split rewards among miners--the miner who finds it gets paid.</p>
			<p><strong>Reality check:</strong> Solo mining is probabilistic. Small miners can go months or years without finding a block. We don't know when--or if--you'll find one.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="card">
			<h2>Payment System</h2>
			<p>We use <strong>split-coinbase payouts</strong>, meaning you get paid directly from block rewards. Your Bitcoin address is written into the coinbase transaction itself--there's no pool wallet involved. This makes it mathematically impossible for us to keep your share. Your address is verified before any work is accepted, and you can verify all coinbase outputs on your worker page.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="card">
			<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
			<p>Our server is located in Detroit, Michigan at a major peering location with direct connections to three tier 1 carriers: Cogent, Hurricane Electric, and GTT. Hardware includes dual-socket Xeon E5-2680 v4 processors, 64GB RAM, SSD storage, and a dedicated gigabit fiber link.</p>
			<p><strong>Why infrastructure matters:</strong> A fast path from your miner to our stratum server is good, but what really matters is the complete chain: miner → stratum → Bitcoin node → network. We prioritize the entire path with local high-speed node connectivity and multiple tier 1 network paths for rapid block propagation to reduce orphan risk.</p>
			<p>We perform approximately monthly maintenance reboots for kernel security updates.</p>

		<div class="card">
			<h2>Technical Stack</h2>
			<p>Custom-built pool software written in Go, running a Bitcoin Core node with RPC and ZMQ for low-latency block template updates. Each miner connection runs independently on its own goroutine for responsive communication under load.</p>

			<h2>Choosing a Pool</h2>
			<p><strong>Be skeptical of every pool.</strong> Some pools have coinbase transactions that don't reward miners at all, meaning your work earns nothing. Always verify on-chain payouts.</p>
			<p><strong>Split coinbase vs. pool wallets:</strong> Without split coinbase, you're trusting the operator to pay you from their wallet after receiving the block reward. With split coinbase, your address is in the coinbase transaction itself--cryptographically guaranteed.</p>
			<p>Red flags to watch for:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>No miner payouts</strong> -- Coinbase doesn't include miner addresses</li>
				<li><strong>No split coinbase</strong> -- Requires trusting the operator to pay you later</li>
				<li><strong>Insufficient infrastructure</strong> -- Unreliable hardware, poor connectivity, or shared hosting</li>
				<li><strong>Claims that don't align with economics</strong> -- If it seems too good to be true, investigate</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Use tools like <a href="https://github.com/WantClue/pool-investigator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pool Investigator</a> by WantClue to verify on-chain behavior. Our code is open source, our payouts are verifiable on-chain, and our fees reflect actual costs. Trust, but verify.</p>
